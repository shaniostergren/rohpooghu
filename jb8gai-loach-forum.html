                            <p> Hi! I made a post on the World of Warcraft forums for this, and would like feedback and further ideas for this. If you're interested in reading the thread, or giving it a like after reading it here, it's located here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769657281 For the post, let me present it: Hello, everyone! I want to sit down with you all, and see if you're interested in this idea, and maybe get some traction for it to be implemented by the game developers. Currently with Mining. 
Three of us in our family attended the sold out preview of 'Apostasy'. As quiet faders, we were excited to see the film but also nervous about bumping into people who knew us. As it turned out, a person I recognised from a past forum came with her son and sat next to us. I introduced myself and my family, and she remembered my online self too. Meeting up irl like that was pretty amazing :) It was a pity we were hurried out of the cinema after the QampA (it was closing) because the atmosphere. This is the forty-fourth entry in the Missing in Georgia series highlighting missing persons cases in the state of Georgia. Once a week (typically Monday) I will be posting 1-5 cases from Georgia's Charley Project page. I will move on to the unidentified after I make it through the missing. The last case I posted can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/7zcl4h/missing_in_georgia_43_shawndell_mcleod_shannon/ --- Becky Annette Minish was last seen departing. When I first stumbled into r/EliteDangerous, I remember being overwhelmed by the many abbreviations and slang terms being used. After hanging around for a few months they all become second nature, but for the new commanders I thought I'd put together a quick reference. This is not meant to be a replacement for the excellent Elite Wiki ( and it has grown rather larger than I originally intended, but hopefully it will be of some use.

This results in stifled variety between ship builds, causing combat and designing loadouts to be a lot less enjoyable. - The contributions have been amazing - huge thanks to everybody! I'm currently editing the main post to include some recent beta tests. I will then compile all the information and suggestions we've gathered, making a more concise Before entering this year I enjoyed films but knew relatively little about them - I'd seen most of the modern films on the IMDB lists but very little more. Around January time I stumbled into /r/truefilm, discovered the Sight amp Sound 2012 lists, and realised there was a whole world of film I was missing. I'd seen the odd Lynch, Coen Brothers, Kubrick, Kaufman, etc, but never really understood what I was watching as I had very little appreciation or understanding of the depth of film. Moving.

The first post launch update is here! This is a required update for clients and servers. The full changelog is as follows: General Changes amp Updates Gameplay Changed the way tiebreakers work on Territory mode - now the team which captures the most points will win in a tiebreaker situation, not the team with more points. Made it vastly easier to pick up dropped weapons Now by default, sprinting from prone will no longer return the player back to the prone stance when the player.

Thank you 1 Blood Parrot 1 Red Tail Shark 5 - Sterba's Cory Cat 1 (or 2) Bristlenose Pelco 5 Zebra Loach 10-12 Lemon/Diamond Tetra 8-10 Kuhli Loach. I am planning a 125 gallon tank, and I want both plants and clown loaches, but from what I've recently been told, clown loaches don't always play nice with plants. I searched on this forum, and found someone who had a 125 with both plants and clowns, but didn't get a response to my reply. So I will ask here--anyone have experience with both? How did the plants do? I'm guessing some are better than others--like swords are probably out of the question as clowns eat holes in them, but maybe. I have recently begun the processing of upgrading my small 10 gallon tank to a 20 gallon tall tank. I decided I wanted to try out a planted tank with the new setup. I am a beginner so I am still figuring some things out. My 10 gallon tank only had low light plants such as anubias and marimo moss ball. I was more focused on the fish at the time I started the small tank because it had been a while since I last had a fish tank. Currently with the new tank I have no fish. Only a few plants (more. My girlfriend and I just got a 70 gallon tank. It's a freshwater tank and we had a friend who is an expert on all things aquariums help set it up and get our foot in the door. We have a pretty good idea of what we're doing, considering the fact that we're first time aquarium owners. We've had 1 or 2 fish in the past, but nothing like this. We just got our fish in the aquarium 3 days ago. We currently have the following: 1x Angelfish - He doesn't move around a lot, which concerned

I've recently lost a few fish (A halfmoon betta, two hillstream loaches and a show guppy) so I picked up a few new fish recently and wondered what people are keeping now.

Im relatively new to this hobby, at 6-8 months in, (first 10g, then 35g, now 55g) and have been piecing stuff together as I see deals on Craigslist or LFS's. My latest purchase was a pressurized CO2 system amp pH controller. Ive slowly worked my way up in CO2 over the last couple weeks to get the drop checker just past blue into the green area. This has ended up being about a pH drop of 1 from my tap water (tap is 2 KH, 7.5 pH). My question is this: Will shutting 2 days ago I bought a group of 6 kuhli loaches from my LFS. These loaches were going to go into my 15 gallon tank with 4 danio. Here's where the troubles started. During the first day I started to notice less and less of them, ending up with on 2 visible loaches by 11pm. After easing forums and other websites I put this down to my loaches finding a hiding place or digging into the sand. By the next morning no kuhlis could be seen so again I put it down to them hiding. It was only later
